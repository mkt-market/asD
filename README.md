# Application Specific Dollar
Allows the permissionless creation of a stablecoin (asD) that is always backed 1:1 to NOTE. The NOTE is added to the Canto Lending Market and the creator of a coin can withdraw the carry (i.e., the accrued interest) at any time. However, the contract ensures that it is always possible to burn asUSD for NOTE at a 1:1 rate.
